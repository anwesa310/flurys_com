1. remote => remote is a cloud, where your project folder exists (like google drive)
2. origin => origin is like a alias/ daak naam of the project "folder address" (repo address)

3. whenever we chnage any code in the folder, we need to do the following-
    a. git add -A
    b. git commit -m  "my message"
    c. git push origin <brnach_name>
